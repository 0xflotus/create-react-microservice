Creating scalable, universal and well tested JavaScript application for enterprise companies with many teams and products is a hard task. We at Immowelt Group took gathered all of our knowledge and aimed to fill this void. `create-react-microservice` is a scaffold that will provide you with an mono-repository structure so it is easy as pie to share code with co-workers, best practices in regards to testing as well as server side rendering support. All of it while providing you the whole flexibility of changing stuff under the hood. :rocket:

**What's in the box?**

- Universal by default since we use [AirBnB's hypernova](https://github.com/airbnb/hypernova) render microservice under the hood.
- Built with React, Redux, Reselect and Plow-JS.
- Comes with best-practices in regards on how to unit- and performance-test your universal application.
- 100% Statically typed via Flow from Facebook.
- Built in support for internationalization (i18n).
- No assumptions (ejected by default) about your CSS setup, but with guides on how to setup each in minutes.
- Containerized via Docker.
- Highly flexible and performing architecture under the hood.

**What about Next.js?**

This scaffold is not aimed at "competing" against Next.js, quite the contrary we see Next.js as a valid addition to the scaffold! We even provide you with a guide on how to integrate Next.js into our scaffold structure within minutes! :-)

## Quick Start

```bash
yarn add -g create-react-microservice

create-react-microservice my-fancy-ui
cd my-fancy-ui
yarn run dev
```

**That's it** - A browser should automatically open up [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) as soon as the application is fully ready.
